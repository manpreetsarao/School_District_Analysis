# School_District_Analysis
Using Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook
## Overview of School District Analysis
In this project we helped the Maria the chief data scientist for City School System to analyze the school data from two different datasets. We analyzed the data for school funding and performance based on math and reading scores. 
In this project we have two data sets in the form of *CVS* files.  The school file has columns like school name, type, size and budget. The student file has columns like student name, gender, grade school name, reading score and math score. We aggregate the data and then perform the analysis. Our purpose of analyzing the data is to find out the top five and bottom five schools, average math and reading score of students in each grade level at each school, school performance based on budget per student, performance based on school size and type of school.
## Results

-	The overall passing percentage for Thomas High School dropped after removing ninth grade marks.
-	After removing the ninth graders math and reading scores, Thomas High School is still the second-best performing school.
